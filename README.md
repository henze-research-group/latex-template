# CU Boulder's LaTeX Template

This repository contains an updated version of CU's LaTeX class with support for a couple other features including:

* table of acronyms
* table of code snippets

The resulting PDF contains examples on how to best use LaTeX for a PhD Prospectus.

To use, open `main-cu-prospectus.tex` in your favorite Tex editor. I use TexStudio. You can also upload this entire package to Overleaf to edit collaboratively online.
